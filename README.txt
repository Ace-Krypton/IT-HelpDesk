Database for an IT helpdesk system

The database should store information about users, support tickets, IT assets, IT tasks, and IT expenses.

For users, we want to store their personal information such as name, username, email, and phone number. We also want to track their account information, such as their login credentials and any permissions or access levels they have. One user can create multiple support tickets.

For support tickets, we want to store information such as the date and time the ticket was submitted, the user who submitted the ticket, the type of issue being reported, and the urgency level of the issue. We also want to track any comments or updates related to the ticket, including notes from IT staff members who are working on the issue. Each support ticket is associated with one user who submitted it, and each support ticket can have multiple comments or updates.

For IT assets, we want to store information about the hardware and software used by the organization. This could include information such as the make and model of each device, its location, and any relevant configuration details or maintenance schedules. Each IT asset can be associated with one or more support tickets.

The database should also allow for the tracking of IT-related tasks, such as system upgrades, software updates, and network maintenance. We want to store information such as the task description, the date and time the task is scheduled, and the IT staff member responsible for completing the task. Each IT task can be associated with one or more IT staff members responsible for completing it.

In addition, the database should allow for the tracking of IT expenses and budgeting. We want to store information such as the cost of each IT asset, the date it was purchased, and any maintenance or repair costs associated with it. We also want to track the overall IT budget for the organization, and any spending or expense reports related to IT. Each IT expense or cost can be associated with one or more IT assets.
